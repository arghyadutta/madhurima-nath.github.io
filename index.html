        <p>Welcome!</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/madhurima_nath.jpg" alt="Portrait">
            As a senior data scientist at Slalom, I have developed innovative Generative AI tools, optimised
            data engineering pipelines, and deployed advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP)
            solutions. My background is in computational modeling, algorithm development, and
            analysis of complex systems. I have been recognised for immense technical, business 
            and leadership skills and I leverage technology to revolutionize operational processes 
            and deliver tangible business value.
            
            With multiple years of expertise as a machine learning scientist in consulting,
            I have actively contributed to driving digital transformations within businesses.

            Before stepping into the consulting world, I delved into the realm of computational physics, 
            where I developed algorithms to analyze intricate interacting systems. 
            Utilizing graph theory and Monte Carlo simulations, I explored diffusive processes and epidemic modeling, 
            alongside investigating classic statistical physics systems like the Ising model under external magnetic fields. 
            Graduating with a Ph.D. in computational physics from Virginia Tech in December 2018, 
            I am proud to have worked under 
            <a href="https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/person/stephen-eubank" target="_blank">Prof. Stephen Eubank</a>
            for the thesis <a href = "https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/86841" target = "_blank"> Application 
                of Network Reliability to Analyze Diffusive Processes on Graph Dynamical Systems </a>.
            Since then I've actively engaged with communities like Women in Network Science, Women Who Code
            and Women in Machine Learning and Data Science communities,
            dedicated to fostering inclusivity and empowerment within the tech industry.
