        <p>Welcome!</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/madhurima_nath.jpg" alt="Portrait">
            As a senior data scientist at Slalom, I have developed innovative Generative AI tools,
            deployed Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions,
            and optimised data engineering pipelines.
            My background is in statistical physics, computational modeling, algorithm development, and
            analysis of complex systems.  
            With multiple years of expertise as a machine learning scientist in consulting,
            I have actively contributed to driving digital transformations within businesses.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Before stepping into the consulting world, I delved into the realm 
            of computational physics, where I 
            utilized statistical methods, graph theory and Monte Carlo simulations, 
            to explore diffusive processes and epidemic modeling, 
            alongside investigating classic statistical physics systems like 
            the Ising model under external magnetic fields. 
            Graduating with a Ph.D. in computational physics from 
            Virginia Tech in December 2018, I am proud to have worked under 
            <a href="https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/person/stephen-eubank" target="_blank">
                Prof. Stephen Eubank</a>
            for the thesis <a href = "https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/86841" target = "_blank">
                Application of Network Reliability to Analyze Diffusive Processes 
                on Graph Dynamical Systems </a>.
            Since then I've actively engaged with communities like Women 
            in Network Science, Women Who Code
            and Women in Machine Learning and Data Science communities,
            dedicated to fostering inclusivity and empowerment within the tech industry.
