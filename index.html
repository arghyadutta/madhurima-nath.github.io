        <p>Welcome!</p>
        <p>
            I am interested in understanding the structural and dynamical properties of complex systems.
            Self-driven, dedicated data & analytics professional with great technical, business and leadership skills. 
            I have 10+ years of advanced analytics experience and specialize in NLP and data engineering. 
            I work on developing and deploying AI/ML solutions on cloud platforms for clients. 
            
            Personally, I love solving challenging problems which gives me opportunity to learn and grow. 
            I am also an active member of Women in Network Science, Women in Machine Learning & Data Science 
            and Women Who Code communities.

            Prior to Slalom, I worked on developing algorithms to analyze complex interacting systems and 
            I graduated with a PhD in computational physics from Virginia Tech Dec. 2018, 
            where I worked on
