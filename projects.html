            Healthcare Q&A assistant
        </b> 
        <p>
            A healthcare technology start-up client wanted
            to improve the customer experience of their
            application interface by incorporating GenAI.
            At the current state, the interface would perform
            clustering on the biopharmaceutical and medtech datasets
            at the backend and output the results
            as heatmaps representing the different groups.
            The clients wanted to build a Q&A chatbot which would
            assist both experts and non-medical users 
            to easily gain insights about these groups.
            I paired up with another data scientist to develop
            a prototype chatbot powered by the 
            <code>Anthropic Claude</code> model on AWS Bedrock.
            <br>
            The data from the clustering analysis, 
            was numeric and structured, saved as json files.
            Each group had specific characteristic which
            represented various medical conditions or
            symptoms. The descriptions for these were also
            ingested to provide more context to the model.
            The architecture involved following steps:
            <li>
                Conversion of the structured <samp>json</samp> numeric data
                into textual input for the <code>prompt</code> template
                of the model.
            </li>
            <li>
                Summarization of the descriptions to 100 characters
                to retain the important information, and not exceed
                the token limits of the <code>prompt</code> defined by 
                <code>Claude</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Using <code>LangChain agents</code>
            </li>
            
            Improved application interface, 
            boosting customer satisfaction by enhancing usability and
            accessibility across diverse user groups.
