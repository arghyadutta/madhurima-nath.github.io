            Healthcare Q&A virtual assistant
        </b> 
        <p>
            A healthcare technology start-up client wanted
            to improve the customer experience of their
            application interface by incorporating GenAI.
            At the current state, the interface would perform
            clustering on the biopharmaceutical and medtech datasets
            at the backend and output the results
            as heatmaps representing the different groups.
            The clients wanted to build a Q&A chatbot which would
            assist both experts and non-medical users 
            to easily gain insights about these groups.
            I paired up with another data scientist to develop
            a prototype chatbot powered by the 
            <code>Anthropic Claude LLM</code> on AWS Bedrock.
            <br>
            Ingesting data as-is in the <code>LLM prompt</code>
            increased latency, token usage and thus cost.
            Pre-processing data to extract relevant information
            and summarizing it helped to improve accuracy and reduce
            latency.
            Implementing <code>LLM agent</code> with carefully
            designed prompt and the appropriate tools provided
            a flexible framework to answer various types questions,
            as well as the capability to expand the scope of
            questions in the future.

            <li>
                The numeric results from the clustering analysis
                were parsed to extract the relevant information

            <li>
                LLM pipeline #1: <code>LLM chain</code> 
                to summarize descriptions
                of characteristics of each group which represent
                various medical conditions or symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                LLM pipeline #2: <code>LLM chain</code>
                to propose a name for each group/clusters
                from the heatmaps.
            </li>
            <li>
                LLM pipeline #3: <code>LangChain agent</code>
                to answer questions about the groups.
                <li>
                    A custom agent to interact with AWS Bedrock
                    and Anthropic Claude.

                <li>
                    Graph specific question tools to gain
                    answers from the heatmaps.
                </li>
            </li>
            <br>
            At the end of the engagement we were able to deliver
            a fully functioning chatbot that could be
            integrated with their existing application interface.
            (Note: We were not responsible for the front-end development.)

            Knowledge support tool for sales representatives
        </b>
        <p>
            A leading equipment rental firm chose to build
            a GenAI knowledge-based chatbot as their
            inaugural digital innovation initiative.
            This tool would leverage custom client data 
            in order to assist sales representatives
            respond to customer inquiries quicker,
            serve as an internal training hub and
            replace manual document searches. 
            In addition, internal SMEs (subject matters experts)
            needed the ability to review and update
            any response that was flagged by the end users
            as an incorrect or incomplete.
            I worked with a cloud engineer to deploy
            this chatbot using <code>OpenAI</code> on AWS platform,
            and implemented a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
            approach.
            <br>
            To understand their domain and provide relevant
            answers from their data, various documents (both 
            structured - <samp>csv, json</samp>
            and unstructured - <samp>pdf, html</samp>) were
            ingested into <code>S3 bucket</code> 
            to create a knowledge base.
            Employing RAG architecture was essential to augment
            the <code>OPenAI LLM</code> model and
            provide accurate responses.
            Multiple <code>Lambda</code> functions were assigned
            to handle different parts of the solution, i.e., 
            processing input, returning <code>OpenAI</code> response,
            updating database with feedback from SMEs etc.
            <code>Lex</code> was the backbone of the solution,
            providing all NLP and NLU capabilities to understand
            user questions and determine best possible answers.

            (Note: This project had a front-end developer)
            <br>
            The chatbot provided accurate results
            when tested extensively by the
            users from the firm on a variety of questions.
            There was also a ~22% reduction in response
            time of customer inquiries.
