            Healthcare Q&A virtual assistant
        </b> 
        <p>
            A healthcare technology start-up client wanted
            to improve the customer experience of their
            application interface by incorporating GenAI.
            At the current state, the interface would perform
            clustering on the biopharmaceutical and medtech datasets
            at the backend and output the results
            as heatmaps representing the different groups.
            The clients wanted to build a Q&A chatbot which would
            assist both experts and non-medical users 
            to easily gain insights about these groups.
            I paired up with another data scientist to develop
            a prototype chatbot powered by the 
            <code>Anthropic Claude LLM</code> on AWS Bedrock.
            <br>
            Ingesting data as-is in the <code>LLM prompt</code>
            increased latency, token usage and thus cost.
            Pre-processing data to extract relevant information
            and summarizing it helped to improve accuracy and reduce
            latency.
            Implementing <code>LLM agent</code> with carefully
            designed prompt and the appropriate tools provided
            a flexible framework to answer various types questions,
            as well as the capability to expand the scope of
            questions in the future.

            <li>
                The numeric results from the clustering analysis
                were parsed to extract the relevant information
                from the structured <samp>json</samp> heatmaps.
            </li>
            <li>
                LLM pipeline #1: <code>LLM chain</code> 
                to summarize descriptions
                of characteristics of each group which represent
                various medical conditions or symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
                LLM pipeline #2: <code>LLM chain</code>
                to propose a name for each group/clusters
                from the heatmaps.
            </li>
            <li>
                LLM pipeline #3: <code>LangChain agent</code>
                to answer questions about the groups.
                <li>
                    A custom agent to interact with AWS Bedrock
                    and Anthropic Claude.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Graph specific question tools to gain
                    answers from the heatmaps.
                </li>
            </li>
            
            Improved application interface, 
            boosting customer satisfaction by enhancing usability and
            accessibility across diverse user groups.
